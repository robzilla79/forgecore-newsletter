## Feed summary

Simple AI Orchestrator based on Ralph. The original Ralph idea was to repeat the same PROMPT over and over again, which was still a pretty powerful idea to this day. This workflow builds on top of the original Ralph idea by introducing verification after development, planning iteration before we start development using the same Ralph idea for planning and not just developing code. The entire thing is also free and open source so anyone can start using it right away. I'll be here to answer any questions.

Ralph Workflow
Ship reviewable AI coding runs without babysitting the terminal.
Ralph Workflow is a repo-native orchestration CLI for developers who want AI to handle bigger coding tasks without constant supervision. You write the spec, Ralph Workflow runs planning, coding, and agent review, and you come back to completed work, a run log, and artifacts you can inspect in your normal git workflow.
Why developers use Ralph Workflow
- Run longer jobs unattended. Useful for refactors, test generation, documentation sweeps, and multi-file migrations.
- Keep review in the loop. Ralph Workflow uses reviewer agents during the run, then leaves behind output your team can inspect instead of an exhausted chat transcript.
- Use the agents you already have. Point different phases at Claude Code, Codex CLI, OpenCode, or your preferred setup.
- Keep the workflow in your repo. Prompts and runtime config live with the codebase instead of disappearing into a hosted tool.
Install
PyPI
pip install ralph-workflow
ralph --help
pipx
pipx install ralph-workflow
ralph --help
From source
git clone https://codeberg.org/RalphWorkflow/Ralph-Workflow.git
cd Ralph-Workflow/ralph-workflow
pip install -e ".[dev]" # or
make install # alternative to pip install
ralph --version
Requires Python 3.12+.
Before your first run
Make sure the agent CLIs you want Ralph to call are already installed and authenticated. Ralph Workflow reuses those existing CLIs instead of asking you to re-enter provider credentials into a separate product.
Get it running
cd /path/to/your/project
ralph --init
ralph --diagnose
$EDITOR PROMPT.md
ralph
What to do in that flow:
ralph --init
seeds the project-local.agent/
files.ralph --diagnose
checks that your configured agents and MCP setup are reachable before you spend time on a real run.PROMPT.md
should describe one concrete task with clear acceptance criteria.ralph
starts the unattended run.
Good first tasks
Start with boring, bounded work:
- add tests to an existing module
- fix a known batch of lint failures
- refactor one narrow subsystem
- update docs that are backed by existing code
Depth presets
ralph -Q # quick: small fixes, single iteration
ralph # standard: most features and tasks
ralph -T # thorough: complex refactors, ten iterations
When Ralph Workflow fits
- Multi-step coding tasks that do not fit in one prompt
- Work you want to hand off and review later
- Teams that want repeatable AI execution in the repo
- Anyone trying to stop paying top-tier model prices for every phase of a run
When it does not fit
- One-shot interactive prompts
- Pair-programming sessions where you want constant steering
- Tiny tasks that finish before setup overhead pays off
- Workflows that depend on unpredictable mid-run human input
Where the name comes from
Ralph Workflow builds on the original Ralph idea: repeat a strong prompt until the model can make real progress. That loop was simple and powerful. Ralph Workflow extends it into a repo-native engineering workflow with planning before implementation, verification after development, agent fallbacks, agent-agnostic execution, and customizable pipelines so unattended runs keep moving and teams can review the results with confidence.
